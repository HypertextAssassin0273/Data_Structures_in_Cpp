If you want to become a truly legendary C++ programmer, you have to read the following books:

1) The C++ Programming Language (4th edition - the one that covers C++11) - by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++.
   This is an absolutely MUST-READ book. This covers the basics and essentials needed to be a competent beginner.
   It must be read cover to cover (it's voluminous, but the effort spent in reading it would pay off big time).

2) The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference (2nd Edition, the one that covers C++11) - by Nicolai M. Josuttis.
   This is a pretty comprehensive reference for the STL.

3) Once you have a grasp of the language and the standard template library, it's time to move on to the Do's and Don'ts, 
   and the best books in this category are the "Effective" series books from Scott Meyers:
	
	a) Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs
	
	b) More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs
	
	c) Effective STL: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of the Standard Template Library
	
	d) Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14

4) After the above books have been read, you would be ready to look at templates in details, and there is just one book
   that covers everything: C++ Templates: The Complete Guide - by David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis. 
   Unfortunately this book covers only C++98/03 but the wealth of information in it is still invaluable.
   I hear that a second edition covering C++11/14 is in the works and shall be available soon.

5) Once you finish reading the above, you would be all set to master design principles. The two books to read for design are:
	
	a) Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides.
	   this one is a classic, and almost a mandatory reading for any OO-design work.
	
	b) Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied - by Andrei Alexandrescu.
	   This book doesn't cover C++11, but is still pretty good.

6) After reading all the above, you can look at the internals of C++: Inside the C++ Object Model - by Stanley B. Lippman.
   This book talks about how C++ objects are laid out in memory and things like virtual tables.

A thorough reading of the above books will make you a truly world-class C++ programmer.
It's a long road, but it's a journey worth undertaking.
