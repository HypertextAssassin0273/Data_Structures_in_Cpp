1) The Key Differences Between Data vs Information:

- Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.

- While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.

- Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide
  a big-picture view of how it all fits together.

- Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information. 

- Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.

- Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. 
  Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.

- Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.


2) Key Differences Between Information and Knowledge:

- Information denotes the organised data about someone or something obtained from various sources
  such as newspaper, internet, discussions, etc. Knowledge refers to the awareness or understanding 
  on the subject acquired from education or experience of a person.

- Information is nothing but the refined form of data, which is helpful to understand the meaning. 
  On the other hand, knowledge is the relevant and objective information that helps in drawing conclusions.

- Data compiled in the meaningful context provides information. Conversely,
  when information is combined with experience and intuition, it results in knowledge.

- Processing improves the representation, thus ensures easy interpretation of the information. 
  As against this, processing results in increased consciousness, thus enhances subject knowledge.

- Information brings on comprehension of the facts and figures. 
  Unlike, knowledge which leads to the understanding of the subject.

- The transfer of information is easy through different means, i.e. verbal or non-verbal signals. Conversely,
  the transfer of knowledge is a bit difficult, because it requires learning on the part of the receiver.

- Information can be reproduced in low cost. However, exactly similar reproduction of knowledge is not possible
  because it is based on experiential or individual values, perceptions, etc.

- Information alone is not sufficient to make generalisation or predictions about someone or something. 
  On the contrary, knowledge has the ability to predict or make inferences.

- Every information is not necessarily a knowledge, but all knowledge is an information.


3) Examples of Data vs Information:
- At a restaurant, a single customer’s bill amount is data. However, when the restaurant owners
  collect and interpret multiple bills over a range of time, they can produce valuable information, such as
  what menu items are most popular and whether the prices are sufficient to cover supplies, overhead, and wages.

- The number of likes on a social media post is a single element of data. 
  When that’s combined with other social media engagement statistics, like followers, comments,
  and shares, a company can intuit which social media platforms perform the best and
  which platforms they should focus on to more effectively engage their audience.


4) How Businesses Can Leverage Data and Information:
- Allows us to make smarter and faster business decisions.

- For example, a company might gather data about the performance of their ads or content.
  They could organize and interpret that data to produce a wealth of insights, 
  like what types of graphics, phrases, and even products are most appealing to their customer base. 
  They may also be able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of their target audience, 
  which can help them make decisions about future offerings, branding, and communication preferences.

- However, there can be several roadblocks to creating that sort of data-driven organizational culture. 
  For example, different teams may collect and maintain disparate sets of information.
  Without a central database, others in the company can’t interpret or benefit from that data. In addition,
  if no one consistently oversees the data, the data may not be of adequate quality for interpretation
  and as a result, any information derived from that data could be misleading or inaccurate.

- To create a truly effective data-driven culture, it’s critical that you maintain the information and
  insights gleaned from data in a centralized source that’s available organization-wide 
  (like a knowledge management system), implement protocols to ensure data quality,
  and cultivate analytics skills across all departments.
