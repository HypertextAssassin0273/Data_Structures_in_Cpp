SUMMARIZED STATUS:-
- Vector: revised recently on 10/11/22, no improvements needed as for now [future work: resize method's capacity growth needs to be similar to std::vector]
- String: revised recently on 7/10/22, no improvements needed as for now
- Segmented_Vector: revised recently on 10/13/22, insert_chunk needs to be completed (i.e. not ready for all cases)
- F_Stack: revised recently on 10/9/22, no improvements needed as for now
- HF_Stack: revised recently on 10/9/22, needs concept revision for more optimized Segmented_Vector [chances are: 90% dead-end approach]
- F_Deque: revised recently on 10/12/22, no improvements needed as for now
- Deque: revised recently on 10/12/22, no improvements needed as for now
- Segmented_Deque: needs concept implementation from Segmented_Vector.hpp & form data concept from Deque.hpp & HF_Deque.hpp [future work]
- Indexed_Struct: revised recently on 10/19/22, no improvements needed as for now
- M.A.A.T.A: revised recently on 12/17/22, need deep copy {a.k.a. copy semantics} operations for more flexible data manipulation.
- O.M.A.A.T.A: revised recently on 12/17/22, more indexing methods needed for range search queries with indexer {deque.hpp} [future work: replace it with segmented_deque.hpp]
- Linked_Lists, Special_Structures need C++03 updates
- Contiguous Structures have to have separate primitive/object type handling [using template specialization or SFINAE rule]


TIP:-
- To create a log file, open notepad and type .LOG on 1st line and then press ENTER to move on the next line. After that,
  just save file with any descriptive name. The next time you'll open it, it will work as log file. TADA!!!
